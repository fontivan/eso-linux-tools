# eso-ttc-linux-updater

This script should make it easier to automate downloading the TTC price tables for playing ESO on Linux.

In particular this has been designed to be added as a pre-launch script to Lutris but you could probably do something similar with a Steam installation too.

Checkout the repositroy and make sure to set the correct path for your addons folder in etc/update-ttc-price-tables.config, then just run bin/update-ttc-price-tables.sh
